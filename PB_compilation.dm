Many feel the Alethi bloodthirst they call the Thrill during battle, a lust of blood that can't be quenched by anything less. They practice tirelessly with great axes that are pale imitations of shard blades so that when they enter battle they can drown themselves in the Thrill, then the enemy's entrails."

They are often the 2nd or 3rd born sons with little inheritance but plenty of financial support to bring glory to the family name on the field of battle. They are given the best equipment and training, and must personally tame a ferocious leogryph to earn the title. Still, there are worse fates than having the best and being the best."

#descr "Alethkar is a land of windswept hills periodically battered by brutal storms. Storms with such force that to be left out during one is a ritual death sentence. Storms so powerful it shapes the people, their architecture, their society and their religion. The storms are not without their benefits however; rich nutrients are churned up from the sea and deposited on the fields after each passing, and it ingrained a stubborn, never-surrender attitude in those who learned to survive it. Aelthi society is tiered, with the main separation by eye colours; those with bright colours are of a higher class than those of darkeyes. They are further divided into ten steps, for a total of twenty classes, with the Lighteye Highprince or Highprincess being at the top, or 1st Dahn, and a darkeyed criminal at the bottom, or 10th Nahn. Citizens can move up and down their rankings by behaviour, professional skills, and wealth. However, the gap between a lighteye and a darkeye may never be breached."

#descr "Though the Beastmen are generally loyal to Moreau and his commandments, exceptions do occur. A beastman who breaks the commandments will lose some of the gift of reason, becoming erratic and dangerous. Beastman soldiers are therefore not trusted to guard the cities of men, instead human enforcers are trained. 

They rely on two main lines of defense - firstly, they show no fear. This on it‚Äôs own can be enough to prevent an attack by a rogue beastman. Secondly, they carry crossbows and are exceptional marksmen. Beastmen soldiers are not given shields, so rogues are easy prey for their bolts. They carry swords as a last resort, though they are often unskilled in their use."

Edward Prendick, Traveller

Larger beasts such as horses and oxen will often retain something of their size as a Beastman. Despite their affinity for manual labour, they are also recruited as soldiers, where they are given iron armour and expected to form the vanguard of the army."

#descr "Each of these creatures, despite its human form, its rag of clothing, and the rough humanity of its bodily form, had woven into it - into its movements, into the expression of its countenance, into its whole presence - the unmistakable mark of the beast.
Edward Prendick, Traveller. 

Each Beastman bears some legacy of its original form in its appearance, its movements and in its mannerisms. For the majority, this is perhaps more of a hindrance than a benefit. Considered expendable, they are dressed in furs that are made from the pelts shed during the transformation of animals into Beastmen, though the irony of this seems to be lost on them."

His eyes were blood-shot at the edges, with scarcely a rim of white round the hazel pupils. There was a curious glow of excitement in his face.
Edward Prendick, Traveller

Some few Beastmen distinguish themselves by retaining a greater part of the physical capabilities, reflexes and ferocity from their original form. Mostly originating from carnivorous hunting beasts, they form an elite force in the armies of Vivis, being granted the finest equipment and an untransformed, trained lion as a steed. The prestige of their role makes them arrogant when around their lesser brethren, though they remain subservient around humans."

An Accredited Apprentice is a more experienced mage, though they were not taught by Moreau himself. In the early years, more paths of magic than those taught by Moreau were discovered, though not all were accepted as suitable. Regardless, these later apprentices practice a broader range of magic than the original pupils. They are respected for their religious connection to Moreau, much like the Seeking Students."

But their real strength comes instead from their resistance to fire and shock. An anomaly among normal Tloafans, Floating Guardians have to ingest a variety of alchemical potions and have much surgery performed before they can resist both lightning and high temperatures. As a side effect, they are also much more hardy. But as with most things these boons come at a cost, and the Floating Guardians are perpetually hungry, eating twice the amount of food a normal Tlaofan does. The mages of Tloaf work round the clock to try and develop a better solution to the threat of enemy archers but the crude mutagenics have so far been the only effective solution."

#descr "The ascended Fletchers of Tloaf are masters of archery, able to fire seeking arrows from miles away or support the Earth Piercers with guiding Desert Winds. However, due to their negligence in terrain destruction, they are not as spiritually respected as the Earth Melters and Crackers. Perhaps due to a selfless act of their predecessors who cast the rituals of perpetual floating, they are resistant to mutation and are whispered to be unfinished."

#descr "Even though they do not directly participate in the revenge against the ground that is so esteemed in Tloaf, Terramorphic Zealots are viewed as the pinnacle of floating faith. This is due to their abnormally skilled oratory skills and their incredibly concentrated hatred of the ground. Sermons are held almost hourly about the horror of the Twsnbnwdd, the lost glory of Tloaf, and the bright future ahead. It is they who inspire the people of Tloaf, it is they who muster support against external threats, it is they who aid the weak, it is they who supply the needy."

#descr "As with any militaristic nation, Tloaf has generals to lead their armies. Taken from the ranks of ordinary soldiers, these generals are inspirational to their followers as they are inspired by their leader‚Äôs past feats that garnered them such a position. Despite this humble origin, the generals of Tloaf are often overindulgent in food and regularly eat twice that of a regular Tloafan. Some whisper that this is a curse, but most shrug it off as just another side effect of mutagenic experimentation."

#descr "Tloaf was once a great empire, but they searched too deep into the secrets of the earth and all who touched the ground were killed by that which shall not be named who dwells deep. The Twsnbnwdd, as it came to be called, was never defeated, only bypassed through the emergency usage of air magic. But the Tloafans were untrained in this art, and forever changed their bodies into masses of floating flesh to escape the calamity. This led to a development of a culture of mass batch mutations, and now extra arms and strange properties are common in subsections of tailor made bodies. As most of the tools for experimentation were lost to the Twsnbnwdd the mutations are crude. Only in The Floating Complex are the mutations truly understood, but the practices are very much habitual outside the capital.

In the decades since the attack of the Twsnbnwdd, the people of Tloaf have never forgotten the lore that lead to their transformation. Earth magic is still commonly practiced and studied, for to give up after the attack would be admitting defeat and weakness to the Twsnbnwdd. Now the Tloafans hear the word the Awakening God and march forth from the Floating Complex."
